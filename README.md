#Markoff

A self-destructing to-do list app.  Based on 'Blocitoff' from of Bloc.io's Ruby on Rails Training.

##Application Description:

A to-do list app with self-archiving tasks. Most to-do list apps gather old, outdated tasks, until performing housekeeping on your to-do list eats up all the time you're supposed to be saving! Markoff doesn't let the bloat get the upper hand.  After its expiration days, a task that hasn't been marked complete will self-archive, doing the housekeeping for you.

You'll also be able to see how well you're gettings things done by viewing stats on your complete and exprired items.
