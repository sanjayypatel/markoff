#Markoff

A self-destructing to-do list app.  Based on 'Blocitoff' from of Bloc.io's Ruby on Rails Training.

##Application Description:

A to-do list app with self-destructing tasks. Most to-do list apps gather old, outdated tasks, until performing housekeeping on your to-do list eats up all the time you're supposed to be saving! Markoff doesn't let the bloat get the upper hand.  After 7 days, a task that hasn't been marked complete will self-destruct, doing the housekeeping for you.
